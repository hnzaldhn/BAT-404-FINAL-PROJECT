SCHOOL CLOSURES DUE TO COVID 19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, and one significant area that has been greatly affected is education. As a result of the unprecedented global health crisis, schools worldwide have faced extended closures as a measure to slow the spread of the virus. The closure of educational institutions has been a challenging and complex decision, taken by governments and health authorities to prioritize the safety and well-being of students, teachers, and the wider community.

School closures due to COVID-19 have become a widespread phenomenon, impacting millions of students across the globe. The contagious nature of the virus and its ability to rapidly transmit among individuals have necessitated drastic measures to minimize its spread. By closing schools, authorities aimed to create physical distance between students, thereby reducing the risk of infection and preventing the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed. This preventive action became crucial in curbing the transmission of the virus, especially in the early stages of the pandemic when knowledge about the virus was limited.
