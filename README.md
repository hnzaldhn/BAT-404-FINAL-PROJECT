SCHOOL CLOSURES DUE TO COVID 19 

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on various aspects of our lives, and one significant area that has been greatly affected is education. As a result of the unprecedented global health crisis, schools worldwide have faced extended closures as a measure to slow the spread of the virus. The closure of educational institutions has been a challenging and complex decision, taken by governments and health authorities to prioritize the safety and well-being of students, teachers, and the wider community.

School closures due to COVID-19 have become a widespread phenomenon, impacting millions of students across the globe. The contagious nature of the virus and its ability to rapidly transmit among individuals have necessitated drastic measures to minimize its spread. By closing schools, authorities aimed to create physical distance between students, thereby reducing the risk of infection and preventing the healthcare system from becoming overwhelmed. This preventive action became crucial in curbing the transmission of the virus, especially in the early stages of the pandemic when knowledge about the virus was limited.

The closure of schools has not been a decision taken lightly, as it has far-reaching consequences for students, families, and society as a whole. Education is a fundamental right for children and adolescents, providing not only knowledge but also social interaction, emotional support, and essential life skills. The abrupt interruption of in-person learning has led to significant disruptions in students' academic progress, leaving them to adapt to new modes of remote learning. The challenges of remote education, including limited access to technology, a lack of personal interaction, and the need for parental supervision, have created unequal learning opportunities among students, exacerbating existing educational disparities.
Furthermore, the closure of schools has impacted the overall well-being of students beyond academic concerns. Schools serve as a safe space for many children, providing access to nutrition programs, mental health support, and socialization opportunities. With schools closed, vulnerable students may face increased food insecurity, isolation, and limited access to critical support services. The closure of educational institutions has also presented challenges for working parents, who have had to juggle their professional responsibilities with childcare and education support at home. This situation has further highlighted the importance of comprehensive and equitable support systems to address the multifaceted needs of students, families, and educators during times of crisis.
